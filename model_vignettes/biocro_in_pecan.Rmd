# BioCro Run Using the Virtual Machine


1. Download the **VirtualBox** application from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and open the application. 

2. Download the PEcAn **virtual machine** .ova file from [here](opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/projects/artifacts.php?key=PECAN) and open it from within VirtualBox by going to "File" -> "Import appliance" and selecting the .ova. Start the virtual machine by clicking on the green arrow in VirtualBox. This will bring up a new window, and the virtual machine is ready when it displays `pecan login:`. 

3. Open up the **RStudio** interface to the VM by going to [localhost:6480/rstudio/
](localhost:6480/rstudio/) in your browser. 

4. Use ssh to open up the **command line** for the VM. Do this by opening up a command line program on your computer and execute `ssh -p 6422 carya@localhost`. You will be prompted for a password with `carya@localhost's password:`. The password is `illinois`, and the letters will not appear when you type them in. 

5. Create a new folder for the run results using `mkdir biocro_results`. Edit the XML to include this file path by doing `nano pecan/tests/pecan64.biocro.xml` and changing the third line from `<outdir>pecan</outdir>` to `<outdir>biocro_results</outdir>` and saving these changes. Do the **model run** by putting the BioCro XML file through PEcAn by executing `pecan/web/workflow.R --settings pecan/tests/pecan64.biocro.xml`. 

6. Go to the RStudio instance that is open in your browser. In the file directory, there should be a new `biocro_results` folder, and you can see all the files by clicking on it. The .nc data files that are in the `out` subfolder can be **plot** in an R script, as is shown for leaf area index. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PEcAn.visualization::plot.netcdf("biocro_results/out/SA-salix-chi_leaf-0.159/2004.nc", "LAI")
```
